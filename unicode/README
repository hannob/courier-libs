   COPYING

   This library implements several algorithms related to the Unicode Standard
   (with both C and C++ bindings), notably:

     * Look up uppercase, lowercase, and titlecase equivalents of a unicode
       character.

     * Implementation of grapheme and word breaking rules.

     * Implementation of line breaking rules.

     * Implementation of the bi-directional algorithm.

     * Canonical forms and normalizations of Unicode text.

     * Look up the Unicode script property.

     * Look up the category property.

     * Several ancillary functions, like looking up the unicode character
       that corresponds to some HTML 4.0 entity (such as “&amp;”, for
       example), and determining the normal width or a double-width status of
       a unicode character. Also, an adaptation of the iconv(3) API for this
       unicode library.

Current status

   The current release of the Courier Unicode library is based on the Unicode
   13.0.0 standard.
